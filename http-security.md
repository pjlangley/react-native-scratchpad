# HTTP security 

> Apple has blocked implicit cleartext HTTP resource loading. So we need to add the following our project's Info.plist (or equivalent) file.

```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
    <dict>
        <key>localhost</key>
        <dict>
            <key>NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
            <true/>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
```

> App Transport Security is good for your users. Make sure to re-enable it prior to releasing your app for production.
